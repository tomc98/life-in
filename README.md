# life-in

So, I want to make it simple to animate objects. Use cases include homes, animatronics, wearables, vehicles, etc.
My first use case is for my van, but I want to use it on a variety of things with different inputs/outputs and usefulness.
Features are optionally activated depending on the use case and hardware. Features could include: accessing the internet, perceiving the environment, interacting with GPIO, using long-term memory, and sending data via API.
